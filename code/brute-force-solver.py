"""This program implements the brute-force technique to solve the TSP
(Traveling Salesman Problem)

The algorithm is simple. We simply enumerate all possible combinations and check
which one will minimize the cost function.

The program takes three inputs:
1. A file containing the pairwise costs as a matrix. These can be found in data.zip
2. The output file where the costs of all combinations are written (for debugging etc.)
3. The output file to store the solution found by this method.

The program can be run like this:
$ python brute-force-solver.py problem.txt scores.txt solution.txt
