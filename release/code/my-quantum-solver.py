"""This file implements the quantum solution described in the paper to solve the TSP
(Traveling Salesman Problem)

The program takes two inputs:
1. An input file containing the pairwise costs as a matrix. These can be found in data.zip
2. The output file to store the solution found by this method.

The program can be run like this:
$ python my-quantum-solver.py problem.txt solution.txt

Prerequisites:
* You must have the D-Wave Ocean SDK installed with valid dwave.conf file and a D-Wave user account
